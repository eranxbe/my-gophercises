# Notes
choose your own adventure game, read from json

## encoding/json package:
- json-to-go - https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/ - paste json to get go structs
- parse json

## handler
- when serving http, a handler is a way to literally handle object/endpoint we try to serve. in this example the handler had a story, an html template, and a path function to show example of using different functions for different endpoints.

## render html
- parse html using text/template
- execute the template

the bonus was a fun task
